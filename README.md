# Movie Ticket Booking Mini Project

## Introduction
> **User: Customer**

This is a *Movie Ticket Booking Platform (Web Apllication)*. Users will be able to Register, Login and browse though the latest released movies and book tickets. They will also be able to see upcoming movies which are soon to be released.

> **User: Admin** 

Admin can login using username and password. He/She can add movie show databases, add shows, delete shows and update shows. Basically all the CRUD operations can be performed by admin.


## Important Functionalities in Project
>  **Register**

Users can register using email-id. The data will be stored in the back-end. Form validation is done using *Java validation package(see code)*. Java database connection *(JDBC)* is done in registration servlet.

>  **Login**

Users can login using registered email-id and password. Validation of credentials are done in *login servlet* where JDBC is done.

>  **Form Validation**

Java validation package has been created which takes care of form validation. Validation of name, email-id and password is done.

>  **Booking**

Every screen has three types of tickets which are Platinum, Gold and Silver. User can choose one or more ticket(s) and according to it the bill will be generated. The booking method has some flaws and we are working on it.

>  **CRUD operations**

Admin can add new show, delete shows and also can update shows in a theatre.
